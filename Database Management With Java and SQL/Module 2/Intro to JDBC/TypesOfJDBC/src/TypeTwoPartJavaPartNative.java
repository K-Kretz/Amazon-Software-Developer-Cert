public class TypeTwoPartJavaPartNative {
//    Now, imagine a similar situation where two people, Java and Database, are trying to communicate. This time,
//    instead of using an external interpreter (like ODBC), Java learns a bit of the Database's language directly
//    with the help of a special guide—a vendor-specific manual. This guide enables Java to speak more directly to
//    the Database, which makes their interaction smoother and faster than before.
//
//    However, there’s still a small catch. For this direct communication to work, Java must have this specific
//    guide (the vendor-specific library) installed on its side. While it's less cumbersome than using a third-party
//    interpreter, it does require some setup on each client’s machine.
//
//    With fewer translation steps, their conversations are quicker and more efficient than before, making this method
//    generally preferred over the previous one. This is how Type 2 drivers streamline the interaction between Java and
//    the database, offering a more direct connection but still needing some initial preparation.
