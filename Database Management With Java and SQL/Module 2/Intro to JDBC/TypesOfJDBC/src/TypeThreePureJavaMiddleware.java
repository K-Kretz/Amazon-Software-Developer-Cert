public class TypeThreePureJavaMiddleware {
//    Now, let's consider a new way for Java and Database to communicate.
//    This time, Java doesn’t speak directly to databases or use a specific guide.
//    Instead, they rely on a mutual friend—the middleware server—to pass messages back and forth.
//
//    Here's how it works: Java sends its message (JDBC calls) to the middleware server,
//    using the Type 3 driver as the go-between. The middleware server, which understands
//    both Java's and the Database's languages, then translates and relays the message to
//    the Database using its native driver.
//
//    In this setup, Java can use a pure, straightforward language (Java code) to communicate
//    without needing any extra tools installed. The middleware server handles all the heavy
//    lifting of translation, simplifying the process for Java. The conversation still involves
//    an intermediate step, but because the server manages the database-specific details,
//    Java can interact more flexibly with different databases.
